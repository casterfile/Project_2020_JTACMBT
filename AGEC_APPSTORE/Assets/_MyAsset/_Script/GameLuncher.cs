        /*
         deviceUniqueIdentifier will be use to make sure game won't be lunch on other device
         for example we lunch the Game outside the Store App the game wont lunch since it has no command from the server
         how will the checking works
         -Store: before it lunch the game it will send the deviceUniqueIdentifier and the gameID that i want to lunch
         Then it will lunch the Game
         -Game: the game will check for the deviceUniqueIdentifier and it gameID if it match the server info if it match
         then the game will lunch and the user can play the game

        what problem do we fix here we make sure that game can't be play outside from the machine that it is install
        and we make sure that game cant be lunch without the command from the StoreAPP
